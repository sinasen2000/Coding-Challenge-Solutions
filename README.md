# Coding Challenge Solutions
- These are my own solutions to coding challenges provided by website like Leetcode, HackerRank, CodeChef, Project Euler, etc. The programming languages I use while solving these challenges is Python and Java but I will also use other ones which I will specify the reason in the code. 

- I'm doing this mostly to improve my way of algorithmic thinking, to learn more about the coding languages and how I can use the algorithms and data structures to solve those challenges.
